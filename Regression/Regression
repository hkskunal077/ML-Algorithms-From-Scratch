Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables).
#The Code takes two sets of random data generated by gaussian function with some added random noises.
#We carry out multi-dimensions regression test for d = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
#The regression test do not use any library code but only coded from scratch.
#Then we carry out cross-validation to check and compare Confusion Matrix.

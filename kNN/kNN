K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.
K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.


Coded the kNN algorithm from scratch in Python, Upon requirements of a prediction, the k-most similar records to a new record from the training dataset are then located.

Steps include -- Calculating Euclidean Distance, getting nearest neighbours and making a prediciton.

Dataset Used -- Iris Flower Dataset
